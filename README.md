# CRASH LOG AUTO SCANNER & <br> SETUP INTEGRITY CHECKER (CLASSIC)

## INTRODUCTION

CLASSIC is a tool used for scanning crash logs generated by Buffout 4 (Fallout 4) and Crash Logger (Skyrim), as well as scanning game/mod files for the same games. Starfield support is also on its way.

CLASSIC will provide detailed information on detected settings, errors, and mods that might be causing the crash, along with various suggestions and steps to take depending on what it finds. There are currently around ~250 different checks implemented into the code. CLASSIC also allows you to easily backup, restore and remove certain mod files, check for Script Extender updates, monitor Papyrus logs, scan many other logs for errors and extensively scan game and mod files for any potential problems.

For more info and setup instructions, [see the PDF](CLASSIC%20-%20Readme.pdf).  
CLASSIC is also on Nexus Mods: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/56255](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/56255)

### Dev Environment Setup

The project uses [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and dependencies are managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer).

Our primary IDE is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
`.vscode/` contains config files to aid in working on the project, including extension recommendations.  
In the Extensions sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+X), search for `@recommended` and you'll see a star on them.

You can run CLASSIC or build the exe from the VS Code GUI in the Run and Debug sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+D).

To install Poetry using PowerShell:

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
```

To have Poetry create a Python virtual environment, create a `poetry.toml` file in the root folder next to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[virtualenvs]
create = true
in-project = true
```

Then to set up the venv and install dependencies, in the project folder run:

```powershell
poetry install
```

To verify VS Code is using this venv: press `F1` and search `>python.setInterpreter`.

Updating dependency versions in `pyproject.toml` is handled by [poetry-plugin-up](https://github.com/MousaZeidBaker/poetry-plugin-up):

```powershell
poetry up --latest
```

CLASSIC's exe is built using PyInstaller. You can do so with VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+D) or via command.
To enable compression of the exe, download [UPX](https://upx.github.io/).
Add the folder it's extracted in to your PATH *or* specify the location in the command or `.vscode/launch.json`

```powershell
pyinstaller --clean --upx-dir 'C:\\Path\\to\\UPX' .\CLASSIC.spec
```
